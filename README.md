🌌 cosmiQ — AI-Powered Vedic Astrology System

cosmiQ is a hybrid AI system that combines deterministic astrological engines with LLM-based interpretation to generate evidence-backed, non-hallucinated insights from a user’s birth chart.

Unlike typical astrology apps, cosmiQ is designed to be:

🔍 Transparent → Every answer is backed by explicit astrological reasoning
🧠 Safe AI → LLMs do not make decisions, only explain engine outputs
⚙️ Modular → Independent engines for chart, aspects, dashas, reasoning
🚀 Extensible → Built for future agents, dashboards, and real-world use
🧠 Core Philosophy

❗ LLMs should not think — they should explain

cosmiQ strictly separates:

🔹 Deterministic Engine (Truth Layer)

Computes:
Birth chart
Houses
Nakshatras
Aspects (Drishti)
Dispositors
Vimshottari Dasha

Produces numerical + categorical facts

🔹 LLM Layer (Language Layer)
Converts structured reasoning into human-readable answers
Cannot hallucinate (strict prompt guardrails)

⚙️ Features

🪐 1. Birth Chart Engine
Calculates:
Planetary positions
Signs & degrees
Houses (Placidus / Vedic style)
Nakshatra + Pada
Adds Ascendant dynamically

🔭 2. Graha Drishti (Aspects Engine)
Computes:
Planet-to-planet aspects
House aspects
Interprets meanings:
e.g.
Moon → Rahu → mental restlessness

🔗 3. Dispositor Engine
Tracks:
Sign lord chain
Adds strength hints:
kendra, trikona, dusthana

⏳ 4. Vimshottari Dasha Engine
Computes:
Mahadasha sequence
Timeline (start → end)
Correctly aligned with Moon Nakshatra

🧠 5. Reasoning Engine (Core Intelligence)

Transforms chart into structured reasoning:
Example:
- Moon in Leo house 8 → emotional intensity
- Rahu in Pisces house 3 → mental amplification
- Current Mahadasha: Moon

⚖️ 6. Decision Engine

Evaluates real-life questions:

{
  "decision": "WAIT",
  "confidence": "Medium",
  "score": 1,
  "reasons": [...]
}

Supports:

Career timing
Opportunities
Emotional states

🤖 7. LLM Layer (Guarded AI)
Uses strict prompts
No hallucination allowed
Converts reasoning → explanation

Example Output:

1. Direct Answer:
WAIT

2. Explanation:
- Current Mahadasha: Rahu → uncertainty
- Saturn in 7th → delays
- Venus in 10th → career support exists

🚨 8. Guardrails

Prevents:

Unsupported questions
Guessing
Over-generalization

If no data:

Insufficient astrological basis to answer this.
